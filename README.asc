= Book-As-Code, First Edition

This is a template repository which may be used to start the development of a written book.

We should "develop" books like we develop any software project.  Book-as-code is no different.  Book development should be tracked in a git repo.  Changes to the book should be proposed via Pull Request.  Changes to the book should only be merged after a review resulting in a +1.  After merge, continuous integration should compile the book and output a PDF as well as other formats.  When a new git tag is created, continuous deployment should publish the versioned artifacts to a location (e.g. Github Releases).

This repository originates from the [Pro Git Book](https://github.com/progit/progit2) repository.  The resulting hard fork has had all content replaced with example content.  It has been enhanced with the ability to add inline text-based diagram sources such as GraphViz and PlantUml.

We are using the AsciiDoc format for the text of the book; here's an https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc quick reference].

== How To Generate the Book

The tools required for generating the book assume OSX and the bash shell.

**Ensure you are using bash**, because newer OSX versions default to zsh.
----
chsh -s /bin/bash
----

Then restart your shell by exiting the terminal and restarting it.


**Install tools dependencies**
----
# Install the Brew package manager for OSX (https://brew.sh/)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

# Install tools necessary for compiling the docs
brew install docker-desktop
brew install make

# If you're not a hardcore vi or emacs user, install atom or vscode
brew cask install atom
----

**Configure your `~/.bash_profile`**, by appending the following using your favorite editor
----
# Ensure your git settings are customized
git config --global user.name "First Last"
git config --global user.email userid@domain.com

# Don't forget to add your personal ssh key to the github server to enable SSH git cloning.
# If you don't already have an ssh keypair in `~/.ssh`
#   Then generate one with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
#   And then add the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` key to your github profile's ssh keys
#     https://github.com/settings/keys
----

**Activate your new bash settings**
----
source ~/.bash_profile
----

**Clone the repo**
----
git clone git@github.com:dcwangmit01/book-as-code.git
----

**Generate all output formats of this book**
----
cd book-as-code
make all
----

This will create the following output documents in various formats
----
build/
├── book-as-code-kf8.epub
├── book-as-code.docx
├── book-as-code.epub
├── book-as-code.html
├── book-as-code.mobi
├── book-as-code.pdf

== How To Develop the Book with Live Rendering

The best way to develop the book is to edit the book's asciidoc source files in an editor window, while a live preview
is automatically reloaded in a web browser window.

To start the web browser with live preview, run this command:
----
make develop
----

This will build the html version of the book in a loop, as well as open a browser to the automatically-reloading html book.
