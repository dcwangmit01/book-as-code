= Book-As-Code, First Edition

This is a template repository which may be used to start the development of a written book.  We should "develop" books like we develop any software project.  Book-as-code is no different.  Book development should be tracked in a git repo.  Changes to the book should be proposed via Pull Request.  Changes to the book should only be merged after a review resulting in a +1.  After merge, continuous integration should compile the book and output a PDF as well as other formats.  When a new git tag is created, continuous deployment should publish the versioned artifacts to a location (e.g. Github Releases).

This repository originates from the (https://github.com/progit/progit2)[Pro Git Book] repository.  The resulting hard fork has had all content replaced with example content.  It has been enhanced with the ability to add inline text-based diagram sources such as GraphViz and PlantUml.

We are using the AsciiDoc format for the text of the book; here's an https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc quick reference].
